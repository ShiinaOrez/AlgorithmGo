-----

This package just described a basic, simple but important data structure: **stack**.

Stack is a kind of linear table, the elements obey the rules called: LIFO(Last In First Out). And as a data structrue, it has a set of operation like: **Push**, **Pop**, **Peek** and **Empty**.

This package just defines some basic operation, I wiil show it at next block.
